// GET /api/fleet — business counters for the portfolio dashboard, behind a
// bearer token.
//
// Counts only, never rows: the ops spool's backlog today, the pipeline's own
// counters as they arrive. See collectFleetCounters() for where those go.
//
// Responses that are not a 200, and why each one is what it is:
//   404 — NUXT_FLEET_TOKEN is unset (or too short to be a secret). An app that
//         has not opted into the dashboard should not advertise an endpoint
//         that only ever refuses; to a scanner this route does not exist.
//   401 — a token was configured and the request did not present it. This is
//         the one case that should be loud: a wrong token on the dashboard's
//         side is a misconfiguration someone needs to see.
//
// Rotation keeps two tokens valid at once — see server/utils/fleet-auth.ts.
